b'<p>Our mission at Canary is to build products that empower people to live fearless lives and make decisions about their safety and security. We believe that providing transparency around the data and personal information you entrust to us is critical to completing that mission. Your privacy and trust are our utmost concern.</p>'
b'<p>At Canary, we provide (i) our website located at <a>https://canary.is</a> and related domains (collectively, the "Sites"), (ii) software that you may download to a mobile device ("Mobile Apps"), (iii) services accessible through our Sites and the Mobile Apps ("Canary Services") and (iv) home security devices, accessories and other hardware ("Equipment").

b'<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.

No method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about the security of our Products, contact us at <span>support@canary.is</span>.</p>'
b'<p><strong>Children</strong>\n<br/> Our Products are intended for adults and we do not knowingly collect or store any personal information about children under the age of 16.</p>'
b'<p><strong>International Users</strong>\n<br/> Our business operations and the technical infrastructure that processes collected data to deliver our Products to you are hosted in the United States.
