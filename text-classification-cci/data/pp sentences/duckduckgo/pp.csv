14,Duckduckgo Privacy,this paragraph wa added
15,Duckduckgo Privacy,before that on 9 16 10
16,Duckduckgo Privacy,this paragraph wa added
17,Duckduckgo Privacy,why you should care search leakage top at other search engine when you do search and then click on link your search term are sent to that site you clicked on in the http referrer header
18,Duckduckgo Privacy,we call this sharing of personal information search leakage
19,Duckduckgo Privacy,for example when you search for something private you are sharing that private search not only with your search engine but also with all the site that you clicked on for that search
20,Duckduckgo Privacy,in addition when you visit any site your computer automatically sends information about it to that site including your user agent and ip address
21,Duckduckgo Privacy,this information can often be used to identify you directly
22,Duckduckgo Privacy,so when you do that private search not only can those other site know your search term but they can also know that you searched it
23,Duckduckgo Privacy,it is this combination of available information about you that raise privacy concern
24,Duckduckgo Privacy,duckduckgo prevents search leakage by default
25,Duckduckgo Privacy,instead when you click on link on our site we route redirect that request in such way so that it doe not send your search term to other site
26,Duckduckgo Privacy,the other site will still know that you visited them but they will not know what search you entered beforehand
27,Duckduckgo Privacy,at some other search engine including u you can also use an encrypted version http which a byproduct doesn usually send your search term to site
28,Duckduckgo Privacy,however it is slower to connect to these version and if you click on site that also us http then your search is sent
29,Duckduckgo Privacy,nevertheless the encrypted version doe protect your search from being leaked onto the computer it travel on between you and u
30,Duckduckgo Privacy,at duckduckgo our encrypted version go even further and automatically change link from number of major web site to point to the encrypted version of those site
31,Duckduckgo Privacy,it is modeled after and us code from the http everywhere firefox add on
32,Duckduckgo Privacy,these site include wikipedia facebook twitter and amazon to name few
33,Duckduckgo Privacy,another way to prevent search leakage is by using something called post request which ha the effect of not showing your search in your browser and a consequence doe not send it to other site
34,Duckduckgo Privacy,you can turn on post request on our setting page but it ha it own issue
35,Duckduckgo Privacy,post request usually break browser back button and they make it impossible for you to easily share your search by copying and pasting it out of your web browser address bar
36,Duckduckgo Privacy,finally if you want to prevent site from knowing you visited them at all you can use proxy like tor
37,Duckduckgo Privacy,duckduckgo actually operates tor exit enclave which mean you can get end to end anonymous and encrypted searching using tor amp
38,Duckduckgo Privacy,ddg together
39,Duckduckgo Privacy,you can enter proxy domain into duckduckgo a well and we will route you through proxy e
40,Duckduckgo Privacy,proxy breadpig
42,Duckduckgo Privacy,this feature is part of our bang syntax
43,Duckduckgo Privacy,unfortunately proxy can also be slow and free proxy like the one we use are funded by arguably excessive advertising
44,Duckduckgo Privacy,because of these drawback in http post and proxy we decided to take the redirect approach to combat search leakage
45,Duckduckgo Privacy,however we leave the choice up to you
46,Duckduckgo Privacy,you can deviate from the default on our setting page by toggling the redirect or address bar setting
47,Duckduckgo Privacy,you can also use our encrypted version
48,Duckduckgo Privacy,search history top other search engine save your search history
49,Duckduckgo Privacy,usually your search are saved along with the date and time of the search some information about your computer e
50,Duckduckgo Privacy,your ip address user agent and often unique identifier stored in browser cookie and if you are logged in your account information e
51,Duckduckgo Privacy,name and email address
52,Duckduckgo Privacy,with only the timestamp and computer information your search can often be traced directly to you
53,Duckduckgo Privacy,with the additional account information they are associated directly with you
54,Duckduckgo Privacy,also note that with this information your search can be tied together
55,Duckduckgo Privacy,this mean someone can see everything you ve been searching not just one isolated search
56,Duckduckgo Privacy,you can usually find out lot about person from their search history
57,Duckduckgo Privacy,it sort of creepy that people at search engine can see all this info about you but that is not the main concern
58,Duckduckgo Privacy,the main concern is when they either release it to the public or give it to law enforcement
59,Duckduckgo Privacy,why would they release it to the public aol famously released supposedly anonymous search term for research purpose except they didn do good job of making them completely anonymous and they were ultimately sued over it
60,Duckduckgo Privacy,in fact almost every attempt to anonymize data ha similarly been later found out to be much le anonymous than initially thought
61,Duckduckgo Privacy,the other way to release it to the public is by accident
62,Duckduckgo Privacy,search engine could lose data or get hacked or accidentally expose data due to security hole or incompetence all of which ha happened with personal information on the internet
63,Duckduckgo Privacy,why would search engine give your search history to law enforcement simply because law enforcement asked for it usually a part of legal investigation
64,Duckduckgo Privacy,if you read privacy policy and term of service carefully you will notice that they say they can give your information on court order
65,Duckduckgo Privacy,this make sense because they may be legally obligated to do so
66,Duckduckgo Privacy,however search engine are not legally obligated to collect personal information in the first place
67,Duckduckgo Privacy,they do it on their own volition
68,Duckduckgo Privacy,the bottom line is if search engine have your information it could get out even if they have the best intention
69,Duckduckgo Privacy,and this information your search history can be pretty personal
70,Duckduckgo Privacy,for these reason duckduckgo take the approach to not collect any personal information
71,Duckduckgo Privacy,the decision of whether and how to comply with law enforcement request whether and how to anonymize data and how to best protect your information from hacker are out of our hand
72,Duckduckgo Privacy,your search history is safe with u because it cannot be tied to you in any way
73,Duckduckgo Privacy,information information not collected top when you search at duckduckgo we don know who you are and there is no way to tie your search together
74,Duckduckgo Privacy,when you access duckduckgo or any web site your web browser automatically sends information about your computer e
75,Duckduckgo Privacy,your user agent and ip address
76,Duckduckgo Privacy,because this information could be used to link you to your search we do not log store it at all
77,Duckduckgo Privacy,this is very unusual practice but we feel it is an important step to protect your privacy
78,Duckduckgo Privacy,it is unusual for few reason
79,Duckduckgo Privacy,first most server software auto store this information so you have to go out of your way not to store it
80,Duckduckgo Privacy,second most business want to keep a much information a possible because they don know when it will be useful
81,Duckduckgo Privacy,third many search engine actively use this information for example to show you more targeted advertising
82,Duckduckgo Privacy,another way that your search are often tied together at other search engine are through browser cooky which are piece of information that sit on your computer and get sent to the search engine on each request
83,Duckduckgo Privacy,what search engine often do is store unique identifier in your browser and then associate that identifier with your search
84,Duckduckgo Privacy,at duckduckgo no cooky are used by default
85,Duckduckgo Privacy,in response to effort by the eff and others the major search engine have begun anonymizing their search log data after period of time
86,Duckduckgo Privacy,sure this is better than not doing so but you should note that this doe not make your search history anonymous in the same way that it is at duckduckgo
87,Duckduckgo Privacy,what search engine generally do when they anonymize data is get rid of part of your ip address or turn it into something that doesn look exactly like an ip address
88,Duckduckgo Privacy,and they do the same thing for uniquely identifying cooky
89,Duckduckgo Privacy,however in many case this so called anonymous data can still tie your search together which can be used to reconstruct who you are and what you searched for
90,Duckduckgo Privacy,additionally search engine usually are silent on what they do with the user agent which ha been shown to also have enough information to often be personally identifiable especially if isolated to particular search session day
91,Duckduckgo Privacy,information collected top at duckduckgo no cooky are used by default
92,Duckduckgo Privacy,if you have changed any setting then cooky are used to store those change
93,Duckduckgo Privacy,however in that case they are not stored in personally identifiable way
94,Duckduckgo Privacy,for example the large size setting is stored a l
95,Duckduckgo Privacy,no unique identifier is in there
96,Duckduckgo Privacy,furthermore if you prefer not to use cooky to store setting you can use url parameter instead
97,Duckduckgo Privacy,additionally if you use our bang syntax dropdown which bang you use are stored in cookie so that we can list your most frequently used one on top of the bang dropdown box
98,Duckduckgo Privacy,just like the other setting this information is not saved on our server at all but resides solely on your computer
99,Duckduckgo Privacy,there is also setting to turn this off which you can also set via url parameter
100,Duckduckgo Privacy,particular search are of course not stored
101,Duckduckgo Privacy,an example cookie might look like php 2 amp yelp 19 amp java 4
102,Duckduckgo Privacy,we also save search but again not in personally identifiable way a we do not store ip address or unique user agent string
103,Duckduckgo Privacy,we use aggregate non personal search data to improve thing like misspelling
104,Duckduckgo Privacy,similarly we may add an affiliate code to some ecommerce site e
105,Duckduckgo Privacy,amazon amp
106,Duckduckgo Privacy,ebay that result in small commission being paid back to duckduckgo when you make purchase at those site
107,Duckduckgo Privacy,we do not use any third party to do the code insertion and we do not work with any site that share personally identifiable information e
108,Duckduckgo Privacy,name address etc
109,Duckduckgo Privacy,via their affiliate program
110,Duckduckgo Privacy,this mean that no information is shared from duckduckgo to the site and the only information that is collected from this process is product information which is not tied to any particular user and which we do not save or store on our end
111,Duckduckgo Privacy,it is completely analogous to the search result case from the previous paragraph we can see anonymous product info such that we cannot tie them to any particular person or even tie multiple purchase together
112,Duckduckgo Privacy,this whole affiliate process is an attempt to keep advertising to minimal level on duckduckgo
113,Duckduckgo Privacy,finally if you give u feedback it may be stored in our email
114,Duckduckgo Privacy,however you can give anonymous feedback by not entering your email or other personal info on the feedback form
115,Duckduckgo Privacy,information shared top if you turn redirects off in the setting and you don either turn post on or use our encrypted site then your search could leak to site you click on
116,Duckduckgo Privacy,yet a explained above this doe not happen by default
117,Duckduckgo Privacy,also like anyone else we will comply with court ordered legal request
118,Duckduckgo Privacy,however in our case we don expect any because there is nothing useful to give them since we don collect any personal information
119,Duckduckgo Privacy,other other search engine top if you care about search privacy you might also want to check out these other search engine that take it seriously by default
120,Duckduckgo Privacy,ixquick privacy policy each doe thing bit differently in term of privacy and very differently in term of result
121,Duckduckgo Privacy,and not all go a far a duckduckgo in some aspect
122,Duckduckgo Privacy,however none store your personal information by default which make them all pretty safe in our opinion
123,Duckduckgo Privacy,update top if this policy is substantively updated we will update the text of this page and provide notice to you at http duckduckgo
124,Duckduckgo Privacy,com about by writing updated in red next to the link to this page in the footer for period of at least 30 day
125,Duckduckgo Privacy,feedback top gabriel weinberg am the founder of duck duck go and personally wrote this privacy policy
126,Duckduckgo Privacy,if you have any question or concern please submit feedback
127,Duckduckgo Privacy,add duckduckgo to firefox duckduckgo
128,Duckduckgo Privacy,privacy simplified
