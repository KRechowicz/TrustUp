A repeat infringer is anyone who has been notified of infringing activity more than once and/or has had any User Content removed from the Services more than twice. We also reserve the right to decide whether Content or User Content is appropriate and complies with this Agreement for violations other than copyright infringement and violations of intellectual property law, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscene or defamatory material, or excessive length. We may remove such User Content and/or terminate your access for uploading such material in violation of this Agreement at any time, without prior notice and at our sole discretion.

Any payment terms presented to you in the process of obtaining your Membership are deemed part of this Agreement and are incorporated herein by reference.

b. Billing. We may collect payments from you directly or we may use a third-party payment processor ( “Payment Processor”) to bill you through a payment account linked to your Account on the Services (your “Billing Account”) for your Membership. The processing of payments by a Payment Processor will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of such Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement. We are not responsible for any errors by a Payment Processor. By choosing to purchase a Membership, you agree to pay us, either directly or through a Payment Processor, all Membership Fees and other charges at the prices then in effect and in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through a Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your “Payment Method”). You agree to make payment using your selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that we or a Payment Processor make even if we or a Payment Processor have already requested or received payment.

c. Payment Method.The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through a Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.

d. Recurring Billing.The Membership payment terms may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you.  By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Membership Fees have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation.  WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY, ANNUALLY, OR EVERY EIGHTEEN MONTHS, DEPENDING ON YOUR SUBSCRIPTION) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO ACCOUNT SETTINGS AT https://app.whoop.com.

e. Current Information Required. YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD.

IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY SUBSCRIPTION FEES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AS SET FORTH ABOVE.

f. Auto-Renewal. The Membership will be automatically extended for successive monthly renewal periods in the event you have purchased a monthly Membership or successive twelve (12) month periods in the event you have purchased a twelve (12) or eighteen (18) month Membership at the then-current non-promotional rate.

Your Membership cannot be terminated before the end of the period for which you have already paid, and except as expressly provided in these terms, WHOOP will not refund any amounts that you have already paid.

g. Reaffirmation of Authorization. Your non-termination or continued use of your Subscription reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Subscription. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance or as otherwise described when you initially selected to purchase the Subscription.

Once you have requested your return, you are eligible for a refund of the Initial Membership Fee, less return shipping costs, as long as the WHOOP Strap is received within thirty (30) days from the date you requested the return.

To cancel your Membership within the thirty (30) days of receipt of the WHOOP Strap in order to receive your refund, you must return the WHOOP Strap in the manner described above.  If you do not return the WHOOP Strap within that 30-day period, the refund will not be applied.

Once the 30-day period has passed, you may still return the WHOOP Strap, but you will not receive a refund for all or any portion of your Initial Membership Fee.  While you may still cancel your Membership at any time, the cancellation of the Membership after the 30-day period has passed will not go into effect until the end of the initial subscription period.  You may discontinue your use of the Membership and Services at any time.

Once a return is requested, WHOOP will cancel the Account associated with the return.  For the sake of clarity, you will not be able to use the Account associated with the WHOOP Strap that was returned.

Once a WHOOP Strap is returned, we reserve the right to refurbish the WHOOP Strap for sale or for the WHOOP Strap to be sold as a replacement WHOOP Strap.

LIMITED WARRANTY: WHOOP STRAP
WHOOP warrants that your WHOOP Strap is free from defects in materials or workmanship for a period of one (1) year from the date of your first use of the WHOOP Strap, as described above (such period, the “Warranty Period” and such warranty, the “Limited Warranty”).

To be eligible for the Limited Warranty, you must:

– Have an active Membership with no outstanding balance or any unpaid fees;

– Have a valid Payment Method on file should a restocking fee of $120 (“Restocking Fee”) be charged (as WHOOP is currently unable to process Payment Methods over the telephone); and

WARRANTY REPLACEMENT PROCEDURE
To request a warranty replacement, you must contact WHOOP Support at support@whoop.com, at which point WHOOP shall send you a replacement WHOOP Strap as well as a return shipping label for the defective WHOOP Strap.

If you do not return the defective WHOOP Strap within thirty (30) days of receiving the return shipping label, WHOOP shall have the right to charge you the Restocking Fee for the unreturned WHOOP Strap. WHOOP reserves the right to charge you the Restocking Fee if you do not return the WHOOP Strap as described above, you cancel your Membership or remove your Payment Method.

NON-WARRANTY REPLACEMENT
You may request to replace your WHOOP Strap that has fallen outside of the Limited Warranty (“Non-Warranty Replacement”) for the Restocking Fee.

To be eligible for the Non-Warranty Replacement, you must:

– Have an active Membership with no outstanding balance or any unpaid fees; and

– Have a valid Payment Method on file to charge the Restocking Fee (as WHOOP is currently unable to process Payment Methods over the telephone).

To request a Non-Warranty Replacement, you can do so by logging into your Account page and going to the Lost Strap page in your Account’s Membership section.  You will be prompted to enter your shipping address and information. The Restocking Fee will be charged to your Payment Method on file; should you not have a valid Payment Method on file, you will be prompted to enter one.  Once the order is processed and your Account has been charged the Restocking Fee, your replacement WHOOP Strap will be shipped to you.  If applicable, our Support team may be able to issue you a credit for a portion of the time you will be unable to utilize the Services.
