target_ip.py must be run in PyCharm:

  	-displays the default gateway name and captures the target IP address using Netifaces (based on the network your device is connected to)
  
  
  
sniffer.py can be run in either terminal or PyCharm:

  	-creates a unique ip dictionary by monitoring network traffic (adjust the "count = 10" parameter to alter the amount of packets you want to sniff)
